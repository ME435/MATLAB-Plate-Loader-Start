Starting code for the MATLAB Plate loader guide program.<br>
<br>
Includes a few items:<br>
<ul>
<li>Images that you can use if you like</li>
<li>*PloateLoader.m* a class to do serial communication with the real robot.</li>
<li>*PloateLoaderSim.m* a simulator class that has all the methods of *PlateLoader* but doesn't do serial communication with the real robot.  GREAT for testing without the robot.</li>
</ul>
